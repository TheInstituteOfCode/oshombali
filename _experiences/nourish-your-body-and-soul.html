      class="text-center">Following a purification ritual, you'll visit a
      Balinese healer to create your healing oil. Together, you'll crush 11
      plants and roots, mixing them with coconut oil over a wood fire, blessed
      with Sanskrit mantras. While it brews, chat with therapists over tea.
      After, enjoy a 45-minute massage and take home your oil. End with a
      delicious Megibung-style Balinese meal, a unique tradition where you share
      food on a banana leaf, symbolizing unity and togetherness.</p>

      <p class="text-center">After purification ritual, we will take you to a
      Balinese healer, where you will make your healing oil by crushing 11
      plants and roots in a stone mortar, mixing them with virgin coconut oil
      and then cooking everything over a wood fire. While your oil is brewing,
      the healer will bless the process with Sanskrit mantras, and you can have
      a nice chat with your professional therapists over a cup of tea. Once the
      oil is ready, you will enjoy a 45 minutes therapeutic massage at the
      healerâ€™s home, and, of course, you will take your own oil with you. The
      journey will end with a delicious Megibung-style Balinese meal. This
      unique culinary tradition invites you for a convivial gastronomic
      experience where you eat with your hands, served on a large banana leaf,
      symbolizing sharing and unity.<br /></p><p></p><p class="text-center"><a
