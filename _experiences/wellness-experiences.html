  Far from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this experience takes you to
  a sanctuary of serenity where you will let yourself be pampered in the middle
  of the jungle, a 100% private experience. After a briefing, the day begins
  gently with a 30-minute yoga session. Guided by an experienced instructor, you
  will be introduced to the ancient art of yoga, practicing gentle postures that
  stretch and strengthen the body while soothing the mind. The instructor can
  easily adapt the session according to your yoga level.
