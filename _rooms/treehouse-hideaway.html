  Introducing the "Treehouse Hideaway". Nestled in the heart of a lush mangrove
  and perched beside a serene river, this room offers an unparalleled escape.
  Even here, deep within nature, the gentle murmur of ocean waves can be heard,
  harmonizing with the melodies of the surroundings. Feel the tranquility as you
  relax in the cozy armchair or enjoy the gentle breezes from the sofa on your
  private terrace. Surrounded by nature's beauty, the "Treehouse Hideaway" is
  more than just a room; it's an experience of seclusion and peace.
